# Using placeholders

Usage of placeholder mostly depends on implementation of mod itself. If mod uses simple, one/multiline text 
(for example with Simple Text Format) you just need to add it by just writing `%placeholder%` 
(or in some cases`{placeholder}`, `${placeholder}` or other format which should be provided on mods page).

Inner part of placeholder can take shape of either `category:placeholder` or `category:placeholder argument` (`category:placeholder/argument` before 1.19), 
where `category` is replaced by type (`player`, `world`, etc) or ID of the mod and `placeholder` is the placeholder itself.
Additionally, some placeholders might have additional or required argument provided after first space. It's format
fully depend on mod providing it.

You can check list of [build in placeholders here](/users/default-placeholders) 
and [placeholders from mods here](/users/mod-placeholders).
